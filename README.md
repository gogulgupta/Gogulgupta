# Gogulgupta
# 👋 Introduction

I’m a curious and driven tech enthusiast who believes technology is not just about code or circuits, but about solving real human problems. I enjoy building things from scratch—whether it’s an IoT device, a mobile app, or a complete system that connects hardware with software seamlessly.

I don’t just like using technology; I like understanding how it works at the core level. From sensors and microcontrollers to cloud platforms and mobile applications, I enjoy working across the full stack of modern tech systems.

**👨‍💻 About Me**

🔭 I’m currently working on
Multiple real-world projects involving IoT safety systems, smart automation, Android & Web applications, and embedded electronics. My focus is on building systems that are practical, reliable, and scalable—especially in areas like safety, monitoring, and smart infrastructure.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
Innovative IoT projects, Android / Web apps, hackathons, open-source contributions, and startup-oriented ideas where technology creates real impact. I enjoy working with people who are curious, motivated, and ready to experiment.

🤝 I’m looking for help with
Advanced system design, cybersecurity best practices, optimizing large-scale IoT deployments, and learning how production-level systems are built and secured in the real world.

🌱 I’m currently learning
Cyber Security & Networking fundamentals, Data Structures & Algorithms, modern frontend frameworks like React / React Native, backend integration, and advanced ESP8266 / ESP32-based embedded systems.

💬 Ask me about
IoT automation, ESP8266 / ESP32, sensors & actuators, Android app development, Firebase integration, hardware–software communication, project architecture, and turning ideas into working prototypes.

⚡ Fun fact
I often break my own projects intentionally—because fixing them teaches me more than building them the first time.

**🧠 My Mindset**

I believe learning never stops. I prefer deep understanding over shortcuts and hands-on building over theory alone. I’m not afraid of making mistakes—because every failure sharpens my skills and mindset.

My goal is to grow into a professional who can design, build, and secure intelligent systems that are reliable in real-world conditions, not just on paper.

**🚀 Vision**

In the long run, I aim to work on impactful technology—whether through a strong tech company, research, or my own startup—where innovation, responsibility, and problem-solving go hand in hand.
